How to swim in the deep water - A lone writerâ€™s guide to survival
=================================================================

Starting notes:
---------------

* Working with your manager (and others) who know nothing about managing docs. Most sole writers report to a product manager. Some report to marketing or support.  But all report to someone who is not (and has never been) a doc team manager.  Important to educate manager about what it takes to write and publish docs, how long things take (processes), what tools are needed (and why), etc. 

Hack-a-thon content:
--------------------

Managing expectations (time, etc.)

How to estimate time

Transparency and communication

What metrics are meaningful to your boss? How do you know if the docs are good?

How do you convince people of the value that you bring (managers, developers)?
What if people don't understand how your role should work; don't know how to interact with you?

What if engineers don't understand what you need from them?

What if the management structure is unclear (dotted line reporting structures)?

What if the boss cannot give adequate feedback? How do you set goals?


Extroverts! 

** Scope - what is the doc writers responsibility, and what is not


* Dependencies - make sure your manager understands what information you need and from who - and the impact on your work
