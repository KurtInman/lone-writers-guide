Working with your manager

=================================================================
How to swim in the deep water - A lone writerâ€™s guide to survival
=================================================================

Starting notes:
---------------

* Working with your manager (and others) who know nothing about managing docs. Most sole writers report to a product manager. Some report to marketing or support.  But all report to someone who is not (and has never been) a doc team manager.  Important to educate manager about what it takes to write and publish docs, how long things take (processes), what tools are needed (and why), etc.

Hack-a-thon content:
--------------------

Managing expectations (time, etc.)

How to estimate time

Transparency and communication

What metrics are meaningful to your boss? How do you know if the docs are good?

How do you convince people of the value that you bring (managers, developers)?
What if people don't understand how your role should work; don't know how to interact with you?

What if engineers don't understand what you need from them?

What if the management structure is unclear (dotted line reporting structures)?

What if the boss cannot give adequate feedback? How do you set goals?


Extroverts! 

** Scope - what is the doc writers responsibility, and what is not


* Dependencies - make sure your manager understands what information you need and from who - and the impact on your work
* Proving your value
=================================================================
How to establish value added and positive relationships from the start:
=================================================================
(Notes from the 5-17 East Bay WTD Hackathon)

* Ask a lot of questions
* Have them define what they value in "good writing"
* Ask someone how they see your role working, including how you will function, who you will talk to, and what you will deliver
* Tread lightly when performing an extensive edit or overhaul right out of the gate
* Establish your own competency and knowledge early on (this can be especially important for female-identifying writers)
* Ask for the information you want and need, instead of being general
* Do your best to identify the correct person to ask a question - be intentional
* Find an ally, even outside of your organizational group
* There's a need for written materials that's never going to go away
* Cite studies that prove the value of documentation
* Talk about your own documentation successes, as well as those of others
* Talk to your support or services organization, someone that talks to customers. They should be your ally. Develop this relationship.
* Explain what happens when you _don't_ have documentation that is that good
* Utilize analytics - wouldn't you want a website to be good if it has so many views?
* Lone writers can easily bring things to light - they might later think, "how could I have missed this?" (After this happens, reassure them!)
* Remind everyone that you are there to represent the users' needs.
* ACCEPT CRITICISM
* Do good work in ways that others can see.
* Market yourself as a service within your organization.
* To show the value of your own best practices, tell them that these principles exist, and you're improving their content. Then they'll see how the content improved and recognize it.
* Developers will see what you've done with their work, and then start to imitate you! They'll see what it means to apply standards.
* Have genuine enthusiasm for the work of developers, and your own work as well

=================================================================
How to get quality doc reviews from a non-writing-savvy manager:
=================================================================
Frequently, managers who haven't managed a writer before do not know the type of feedback that we need. For example, a manager might lightly copyedit your work, when what you truly needed a technical review, or their thoughts about a new structure.

Some suggestions for getting quality docs reviews:

* Create a mini-training on how to review documentation
* Specifically call out the "type" of review that you're looking for, be it technical, developmental, etc.
* Reinforce good reviewing behaviors
* Create a review checklist of what you'd like them to read for
